# Secure-Access-with-Azure-Active-Directory

## Objective

The goal of this project was to implement Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) for secure identity and access management. It focused on strengthening user authentication, enforcing role-based access control (RBAC), and ensuring compliance with security policies. By integrating Azure AD, the project aimed to enhance security posture, streamline access management, and reduce unauthorized access risks. Additionally, it provided a scalable solution for managing user identities across cloud and on-prem environments.
